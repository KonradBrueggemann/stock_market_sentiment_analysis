will use historic comments from social media to create a sentiment score chart for a stock
then compare it to the stocks value
goal is to find out whether motions in the sentiment graph can be used to predict changes to the stock price
and if so, to train a model to output buy/hold/sell signals based on a real time sentiment score tracker

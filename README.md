# stock market sentiment analysis tool # 
#### This tool will use historic comments from social media to create a sentiment score chart for a specific stock
#### Then, it will compare the sentiment score with the stocks current value
#### The goal is to find out whether motions in the sentiment graph can be used to predict changes on the stock price
#### If so, we will train a model to output buy/hold/sell signals based on a real time sentiment score tracker
